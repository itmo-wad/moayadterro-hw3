Hello there!

This is a docker build, so you have to run it inside docker environment, nginx serve a flask app which connected to mongoDB
I just made a change on homework2, so now homepage contain posts from anyuser in the system, and only authenticated user can write a post

after git pull, just run docker-compose up to run, it will take time to install dependencies and then it will work great!

screenshot, you can see that i wrote posts from different account
